# fastcgo

Fast Cgo calls using an assembly trampoline. 

## Supported

|        | Window | MacOS | Linux |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| x86_64 | ✅      | ✅     | ✅     |
| ARM64  | ❌      | ✅     | ❓     |

✅ = Working and tested.  
❓ = May work, unknown, no tests.  
❌ = Not currently supported.

## Warning

This is **very unsafe** and lets you call C using the current's goroutine thread's system stack internal to Go. It monopolizes the thread to itself and completly bypass the regular scheduler premptions. It also disrupts the GC while blocked inside C code. Use at your own risk.

## Why?

Two reason:

* Workaround for a [scheduling issue](https://dqlite.io/docs/explanation/faq#why-c-7) when the call lasts longer than 20 microseconds which is causing me visible stutter when calling [glfwSwapBuffers()](https://github.com/go-gl/glfw) with VSync enabled.
* Bring down the [Cgo overhead](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/19574) from 50ns to 3ns (see below).

## Example


```go
package main

/*
#include <stdio.h>
void example(int x) {
	printf("Hello %d", x);
}
*/
import "C"
import "github.com/nitrix/fastcgo"

func main() {
	fastcgo.UnsafeCall1(C.example, 42)
}
```

## API

```go
